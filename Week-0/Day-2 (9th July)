A. What are browsers? 
The goal of a browser is it needs to allow people to hit a specific server and get back some html, css and JS and render it on the screen. Servers are specified with the URL. 

B. Why HTML, CSS, JS?
As eveything on a website/internet can be encapsulated by these three languages, thereby a browser needs to know to render these correctly. 

C. HTML?
Defines the structure of the Website. What is placed where and what all is placed. 


D. div tags: Stand for one full length or length of the page. That means it will take up the entire line in easy words. 

E. WHOLE WEBSITE IS technically inside the html (METADATA), head tag body tag(Actual content of the website). 

F. span tag: Only takes as much space as it needs. 

G. Attributes vs Tags
Attributes define the structure and each tag can have multiple attributes that help define what that tag can do. 

H. Input Placeholder:
<!--<input placeholder ="Username" Type="Text"></input> -->
