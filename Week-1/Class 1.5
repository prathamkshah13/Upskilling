We are going to learn the following:   
a. Async functions vs Sync functions
b. JS Browser architecture 
c. Promises 
5. Async Await 

1. Async functions that JS provides you with:  a. setTimeout(fn, 1000);   //1000 represents milliseconds. 
                                               b. fs.readFile: To read a file from the file System 
                                               c. Fetch: To fetch some data from an API end point. 


2. Async by Ourselves: 


NOW UNTIL NOW WE HAVE LEARNT ONLY THE USE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ASYNC FUNCTION (setTimeout(), readFile etc). NOW WE WILL LEARN HOW CAN WE CREATE AN ASYNCHRONOUS FUNCTION
OF OUR OWN. [This can be done without using a promise. Just a wrapper on top of an async function works fine]. 

3. Promises: 
Promises Syntactical sugar(Pretty way to write, under hood it still uses callback queue, still uses event loop) that make async function code slightly more readable. 

Note: 
1. Promises have no callback. 
2. await: if a function is returning a promise and if we put an .await in front of it then we directly log it/ do some tasks with it. 
3. await is only valid inside an async function.
